# bc-HomeWork-1
Had a rough time sumbitting the homwwork and I messed a lot of stuff up.
First, there was a lot of div tags and had to be chnaged in the code, because I messed up so bad I keep messing with the page images. However, I will do a lot better next time. 

Changed a div tag to header 

Had to move some tag to become children. 

Added a main tag 

Added a article tag 

Added a footer tag
